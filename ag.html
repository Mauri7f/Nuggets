                Aaron Gordon plays the power forward/small forward position for the Denver Nuggets. When he arrived in Denver from Orlando I thought he was a really great addition to the team as he was known to be a fantastic defender and a sensational dunker. As a matter of fact I
                thought that the Nuggets had a serious chance to become the champions in his first year. He complimented MPJ, Murray, and Jokic so well, and he still does. Unfortunately a few games after aquiring AG, Jamal Murray had a season ending injury. 
                Murray would be out for nearly 2 years but in the mean time Aaron Gordon started rising up to be an extremely powerful ball player. He would soar in the air and dunk on others time and time again. He would use his body to "bully" his way to 
                the basket. The time he spent with Jokic helped them develop great chemistry as well. Together they have tons of highlight dunks where Jokic passes the ball to him in the air and AG throws it down with authority. Each time I watch a powerful dunk
                I cannot help but jump out of my seat and put my hands on my head in amazement. The best dunk I have ever seen was on a Christmas day game when the Nuggets played against the Phoenix Suns. Near the end the score was close and AG sky rocketed into 
                the air and slammed the ball over Landry Shammet of the Suns, falling on top of him due to the great force and momentum that Mr. Gordon created, truly insane. The way he fell on top of Shammet made me burst into laughter. I had to include that video below, it is the second one. 
                The first video is a put back dunk that had the Nuggets bench in disbelief. And the third video is nice defensive play that led to a Gordon dunk on the Lakers team in last years Western Conference Finals.
