                Starting at the small forward position for the Denver Nuggets, MPJ is a phenomenal shooter especially from the 3 point line. He stands at 6'10" so it is very difficult for defenders to contest him
                straight away. When he rises up for a shot it is nearly impossible to get a block on him. He had a rough start to his career. Very early on he was dealing with multiple back surguries and many teams
                thought he would not be worth having due to his injuries. But Denver took a gamble and it paid off <strong>BIG</strong> time. After finally having a healthy season last year, he and the Nuggets went on
                to win the championship. Forward to today, MPJ played 81 games this season! more games in the regular season than any other starter this year. Truly an incredible feat considering all that he has been through.
    
                The man talking in the video below breaks down beautifully just how great he is with plenty of recent highlights.
