            Nikola Jokic, nicknamed the Joker is considered by many to be the best basketball player in the world. He is from Sombor, Serbia and he is the starting Center for the Denver Nuggets and despite his nickname, when he is on the court he does not play around. This man is all about winning 
            and doing whatever it takes to accomplish that. Standing at nearly 7 feet tall, he is a lumbering force of nature. Among the many world class skills that he posseses like shooting, passing, and playmaking, he has the stamina of a race horse. I have seen him play entire seasons, extended minutes, 
            overtimes again and again and he continues to dominate the game. As an athlete I cannot express how difficult it is to perform well when the body is tired. He runs all game long and plays at an extraordinary level the whole time! His intelligence for the game
            of basketball is on the same level as the legendary LeBron James who has 21 years playing at the professional level. The video below showcases some of his spectacular plays.
