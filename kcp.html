                I believe that no team can win a championship without great defense and this player is the best defender among all defenders. His elite, world class defensive plays help propel the Nuggets offense essentially doing two things at once, stopping the 
                enemy team, and scoring for his team. The video below showcases this really well as it shows three seperate plays in the same game where his defensive actions lead to a great play on the other end. When the Nuggets play against other great teams
                they tend to put KCP on the other teams best player, meaning he guards them when they have to defend. On top of his intelligence he has extremely impressive shooting abilities from the 3 point line, and a specific "spot" where likes to dribble to,
                then rise up and take a shot. The spot that he likes to go to is often referred to as the "mid-range jumper" and man does he have a great mid-range shot. The Nuggets starting 5 is the best starting 5 because they all work so well together and have
                become a cohesive unit. When each player
                is in sync I truly believe that no team on the planet can beat them. I have to give an honorable mention to the bench guys because if it weren't for their great plays as well, then the Nuggets would probably not have a championship title today.
