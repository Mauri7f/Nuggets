                Jamal Murray is simply one of the best players currently playing in the NBA. He is the starting point guard for the Denver Nuggets so he handles the ball most of the time. He and Jokic developed great chemistry over the years while playing together, 
                that makes them an extremely deadly and efficient duo. Murray and Jokic on the pick and roll is nearly impossible to stop. Either Murry will get a lay up or a mid range shot, or Jokic will get a lay-up or a good shot, either way they almost always score.
                It is the Denver Nuggets bread and butter and they like to run it quite a bit. Jamal is also an impressive finisher, as I have showed in the main page, he is willing to take the last shot of the game despite the immense pressure of the playoffs over him.
                During the regular season you could say he is... regular, but during the playoffs he transforms into a monster. The video below does a fantastic job of describing Murrays incredible talent while showing amazing highlights from his playoff career.
