        The Denver Nuggets are currently in the post season and they are off to a great start! In professional basketball during the playoffs, 2 teams face each other in a best of 7 series. 
        Meaning they play against each other until one of the teams reaches 4 wins. They can potentially reach a game 7 if each team has 3 wins each. This year for the Nuggets, The first round match up was against the Los Angeles Lakers. 
        Many fans may remember last year during the Nuggets' historic championship run, they faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals. This was an extremely impressive series for the Nuggets because they ended up sweeping the Lakers! 
        This means that they only played 4 games because the Nuggets won every game. This year the Nuggets knew that they would be in for a very tough series because the Lakers, led by LeBron James, would most definitely remember the outcome of last years match up. 
        Fueled by revenge and perhaps a bitter taste left after last years embarrassing outage, the Lakers came into this series with a serious chip on their shoulders.

    <h2>Game 1, Saturday April 20th</h2>
    <p>
        Denver Nuggets are at home for the first game of the post season. They get to start at home because they had a better regular season record than Lakers therefore having a higher seeding than them. 
        The game did not start very well for the Nuggets, and the Lakers actually put on a dominating performance in the first half. Luckily the Nuggets got back into the game during the second half and actually ended up winning by double digits!

    <h2>Game 2, Monday April 22nd</h2>
    <p>
        Denver at home again for game 2, started off the same as they did the game before. Off to a very slow start, they were getting clobbered for most of this game. At one point the Lakers were winning by 20 points! 
        For basketball standards, this usually means that the winning team will cruise to an easy victory... Unfortunately for the Lakers, the Nuggets championship mentality once again kicked in. 
        They slowly chipped away at their lead until the final seconds of the game! In what would be the Lakers' final possession of the game, the score is tied and LeBron shoots a three pointer but he misses! 
        The Nuggets would take the ball back up the other way. With only seconds remaining, Jamal Murray runs a play where he gets his team to make space for him on one side of the court as he would dribble up and attempt to take the final shot of the game. 
        Just as time is about to expire, Murray leads Anthony Davis (one of the best defensive players in the world) down the right side of the court, gets into a shooting position, rises up, fades away, and drains a game winning buzzer beater to win a very close Game 2. 
        Above these paragraphs is a photo of Murrays shot and below is an extraordinary video of what happened.

    <h2>Game 3, Thursday April 25th</h2>
    <p>
        The nuggets are in Los Angeles this time around as the usual play off format goes like this. 2 games at home, 2 games away, and if necesarry game 5 at home, game 6 away, and game 7 at home. Once again the Nuggets are off to a terrible start. 
        It is starting to seem like a pattern. Yet again, the nuggets rally back to take the lead towards the end of the game. This game was not as exciting as Game 2 but it was very hard fought.
    </p>

    <br>


    <h2>Game 4, Saturday April 27th</h2>
    <p>
        Now with the Lakers only being one game away from elimination, they had their backs against the wall. Once again at their home, the Lakers put on a dominating display but this time around it was from the beginning all the way to very the end. 
        Finally... after 7 straight playoff losses to the Nuggets, the Lakers break their curse. I guess pressure really brings out special things from these players. To be fair, each game started out very well for the Lakers and the Nuggets had to battle back each time.
        I think they learned that they absolutley must start out strong or else the Lakers may have the fuel needed to pull off the very improbable 'reverse sweep'.

    <h2>Game 5, Monday April 29th</h2>
    <p>
        This game started out just like all the other ones did, surprise. The Lakers came out very strong but at least this time the Nuggets kept it competetive. Though they would be down at the half, they were only down by 3 points. It was at this
        point that I knew the Nuggets had a real chance of beating the Lakers and moving on to the next round in the playoffs. And that is exactly what they did. They were able to use their championship experience and hold off the very angry Lakers. And now its on to the 
        next match up, the Minnesota Timberwolves. This next series will most likely be the toughest match up they have had in the last few years. The Timberwolves led by Mr. Anthony 'Antman' Edwards are a force! But are they good enough to defeat the defending champs
        in a 7 game series? We will find out! Saturday, May 4th Game 1 in Denver!!! <strong>LETS GO NUGGETS!</strong>
